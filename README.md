YourChatCore
============
YourChat, a media-driven chat project application developed in Java, aiming for high modularity

Core-Project:
This will include all the essential backend-stuff, including input and data-handling

This is a complete refactoring of YourChatWebLegacy. This part contains all the backend-functionality. It's redesigned on a "Design Pattern"-basis.
The package structure will definately change! Why?
Because at first I use the monolithic approach to organize the classes and their funcationality by their layer. Second I will continue to reorganize the classes into their logical functions.

It's currently in-progress but some stuff might work.

Targeted to be deployed in a Tomcat, later to be fully container-independent (next goal, JBossAS).
